\paragraph{Eclipse plugin}
The development of the Eclipse plugin mainly depends on
two framework: Xtext\cite{xtext-site}, a framework for 
development of programming languages and domain-specific languages, and
Xsemantics\cite{xsemantics-site}, a DSL for writing type systems
for languages implemented in Xtext.

The Xtext grammar was defined with focus on \cite{verifiable}.
